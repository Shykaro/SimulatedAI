0: Pic_scale from view of Alexander Gassner towards Gustavo Silva: neither close nor distant
 Based on the following Message from Gustavo Silva: *ahem* Ah, yes, Gustavo! Nice to hear from you, I suppose it's about time we got acquainted, given the circumstances. Life has been... decent, I suppose. Still getting used to the new place and trying to find my footing around here. It can be a bit overwhelming at times, but I'm managing. How about you? What brought you to this neck of the woods?
