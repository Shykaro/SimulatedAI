0: Pic_scale from view of Sophia Matthies towards Gustavo Silva: a little bit close
 Based on the following Message from Gustavo Silva: "Ah, yeah, the neighborhood is great, isn't it? I've been enjoying the fresh air and the quiet atmosphere. As for me, I'm doing all right, considering. It's been a bit of a challenge getting used to the new setup here, but I'm trying to stay organized and focused. I actually just finished a project at work that was a big success, so that's been a nice boost. But yeah, it's definitely been an adjustment moving into this new place, especially without being able to meet people in person. What do you like about the neighborhood so far? Have you tried any of the local restaurants or shops?"
