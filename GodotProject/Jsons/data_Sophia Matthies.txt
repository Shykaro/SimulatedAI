As I listen to Hendrik's friendly greeting, I can't help but feel a sense of relief that someone is finally reaching out. The silence had been overwhelming, and it was starting to get to me.

"Hi, Hendrik! It's great to hear from you too," I respond, trying to sound as warm and welcoming as possible. "No, not at all, I'm glad you called. To be honest, it's been a bit lonely since we moved in. The pandemic has made things... complicated." I pause for a moment, collecting my thoughts. "But I've been keeping busy with work and trying to stay positive. How about you? How are you finding the estate so far?"

"That's wonderful to hear that the pandemic has given you an opportunity to focus on your art! I'm a computer scientist by trade, but I've always had a passion for music and literature. In fact, meeting my partner at a concert was a turning point in my life." I pause for a moment, lost in thought before refocusing on the conversation. "As for creative pursuits, I've been known to dabble in writing poetry and short stories. It's more of an outlet for me to express myself and process my emotions."

 Based on the following Message from Hendrik Rabe: I smile, feeling a sense of excitement and connection to Hendrik's interests.  "Ah, yes! The intersection of art and technology is where I find my true passion," I say, leaning in slightly.  "As for my writing, I explore themes of love, identity, and the human condition. My poetry is often more introspective, while my short stories tend to be more narrative-driven." I pause for a moment, collecting my thoughts.  "I think what I love about music is that it has the power to evoke emotions and create connections between people. When I'm listening to a song that speaks to me on a deep level, it's like we're sharing a secret language. It's this sense of community and understanding that draws me in."
