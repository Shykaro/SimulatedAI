 Based on the following Message from Hendrik Rabe: "I'm so glad I could be the one to break the ice, Hanna! It's been a bit of an adjustment getting used to this new way of connecting with people, hasn't it? But I think it's wonderful that you're open to making connections despite the challenges. As for our coffee or tea date, how about 8:30 pm tonight? That would give us just enough time to chat before the evening curfew. And please, let's not worry too much about the 'time constraints' â€“ we can make it work! Would you like me to bring some treats to share?"
