 Based on the following Message from Sophia Matthies: "That sounds wonderful, Sophia! *laughs* I'm glad to hear that your creative juices are flowing. As for me, it's been a bit of an adjustment getting settled into the new place, but I've been enjoying the process. I spent most of my day unpacking and organizing my belongings. It's amazing how much more peaceful the space feels now that everything has its proper place. *chuckles* I also had some time to reflect on my first solo fashion show in Paris, which was a huge milestone for me as a designer. It's still surreal thinking about how far I've come since then."

 Based on the following Message from Sophia Matthies: "Thank you so much, Sophia! *blushes* It was a dream come true, for sure. And I'm glad you think it's essential to acknowledge our achievements â€“ it's easy to get caught up in the next project or goal and forget to appreciate how far we've come.

As for what inspired me to pursue fashion design... I think it's always been a passion of mine, even as a child. I used to love playing with my mother's old sewing machine and creating little outfits for my dolls. But if I'm being completely honest, it was that first solo show in Paris that really solidified my decision to make a career out of fashion design. Seeing my designs on the runway, knowing that people were wearing them and feeling proud of what I had created... it was just this incredible rush of emotions. And since then, I've been hooked! *laughs* It's like my creative spark has been lit, and I'm constantly looking for new ways to express myself through fashion."
