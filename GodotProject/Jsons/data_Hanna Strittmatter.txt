 Based on the following Message from Sophia Matthies: "Hi Sophia, it's Hanna Strittmatter from apartment 3A. I hope you're doing well. I wanted to introduce myself and maybe we could chat a bit about our shared living space? I've been meaning to ask, have you noticed any... interesting features or quirks around the estate?"

 Based on the following Message from Sophia Matthies: "Sophia, it's wonderful to chat with you too! I'm glad you're enjoying your new apartment and the views from your balcony sound breathtaking. As for the estate, yes, I've noticed those symbols on the walls as well. They do have a certain... mystique to them, don't they? I've been meaning to ask someone about their significance, but I haven't had the chance yet.

And wow, you're right about the courtyard! I've experienced that strange acoustics too. It's like the space has its own unique energy. Sometimes when I'm walking through the courtyard, I feel like I'm inside a musical instrument or something.

As for me, I have to say that I've been fascinated by the estate's common areas. The way they're designed and the materials used... it all feels very intentional. And have you noticed how some of the rooms seem to be... whispering secrets to each other? It's as if the architecture is trying to tell us something, but we just need to listen more closely.

I'd love to grab coffee with you soon! Let me suggest a few places in the neighborhood that I think would be great for a meetup. How about this weekend?"
