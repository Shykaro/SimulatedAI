 Based on the following Message from Sophia Matthies: "Hi Gustavo! Thanks for reaching out, it's great to finally talk to someone. Yeah, adjusting to this new place can be tough, especially with the pandemic and all. But I'm doing okay, just trying to find my rhythm again. I love the neighborhood so far, though - it's really beautiful here. What about you? How are you liking your new home?"
