 Based on the following Message from Hanna Strittmatter: Thanks for chatting with me, Hanna! I'm glad to hear that you're working on new designs - that's really exciting! *pauses to think* Ah, yes, the apartment is lovely, and it does take some time to get used to a new place. As a doctor, my schedule has been pretty hectic lately, but I've been trying to make an effort to get out there and meet my new neighbors. It's nice to finally have someone to talk to! *laughs* What do you like most about the new apartment complex?

 Based on the following Message from Hanna Strittmatter: *laughs warmly* Ah, that's wonderful, Hanna! I'm glad to hear that you're finding the community here to be welcoming and inspiring. As for me, I have to say that what I love most about being a doctor is the sense of fulfillment I get from helping people. There's nothing quite like seeing a patient recover or overcome a challenge after working together as a team. And in this role, I've had the opportunity to work with patients from all walks of life, which has been incredibly enriching for me. *smiles* Plus, I have to say that I'm really proud of my recent achievement - completing that 36-hour shift during my residency was quite the accomplishment! *chuckles* But what about you, Hanna? What do you like most about designing fashion?
