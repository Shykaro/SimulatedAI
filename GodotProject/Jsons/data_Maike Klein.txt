 Based on the following Message from Alexander Gassner: *Maike's voice sounds friendly and approachable in my mind, but I still take a moment to process the sudden introduction* Ah, hi Maike! Thank you for reaching out. Yeah, everything is going well, just getting settled into this new place. It's...different, you know? No neighbors to chat with yet, since we're not supposed to meet in person due to the pandemic. But I appreciate your effort to connect. A cup of coffee sounds lovely, actually! Would you like that sometime this week? Maybe around 9 pm when I'm usually taking a break from work?
