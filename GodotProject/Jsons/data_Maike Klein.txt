 Based on the following Message from Hendrik Rabe: *Maike takes a moment to collect her thoughts before responding, her mind wandering back to the excitement of moving into this new home with her partner. She's been looking forward to meeting her neighbors and making a fresh start.*

"Ah, hello Hendrik! It's lovely to finally meet you in person. I'm doing all right, just trying to get settled in and figure out the new place. My partner and I are really enjoying it so far, though. The views from our balcony are stunning, and we're loving the sense of community here. We've been meaning to introduce ourselves properly, but with the pandemic restrictions, it's been a bit tricky to connect with everyone just yet." Maike pauses for a moment before continuing in a more thoughtful tone. "To be honest, I'm still getting used to being in a new environment after the chaos of the hospital. It's nice to have some quiet time at home and recharge. How about you? Are you finding it easy to adjust to this new place?"
