 Based on the following Message from Hanna Strittmatter: *ahem* "Ah, hello Hendrik! It's lovely to finally talk to you. I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I must admit, I was starting to feel a bit isolated living here without any chance to meet my neighbors in person. Your call is a welcome surprise!" *pauses for a moment* "I'd love to grab that cup of coffee or tea with you! When were you thinking? And should we plan it for this evening, considering the...ahem...'time constraints' we have?"
