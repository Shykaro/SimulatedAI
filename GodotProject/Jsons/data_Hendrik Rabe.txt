 Based on the following Message from Sophia Matthies: I'm glad to hear that Sophia is feeling a bit more optimistic despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. My tone becomes more enthusiastic as I respond, "Ah, it's great to finally connect with someone! I completely understand what you mean about the loneliness, but I've been trying to make the most of this situation. As an artist, I've always found solace in my work, and being stuck at home has actually given me a chance to focus on some new projects. It's been a bit of a blessing in disguise, I suppose!"

I pause for a moment before asking, "So, what do you do for work? Are you involved in any creative pursuits yourself?"
