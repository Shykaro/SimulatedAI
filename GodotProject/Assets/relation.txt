*laughs* Ahaha, it's wonderful to share these thoughts with you! You're absolutely right - education and awareness are crucial for driving real change. As artists, we have a unique responsibility to use our platforms to inspire and educate others. I must say, your enthusiasm is infectious!

Regarding certification programs like GOTS or Oeko-Tex, I completely agree. They provide consumers with the confidence to support brands that prioritize sustainability.

And wow, Patagonia and Reformation are indeed amazing examples of companies leading the way in sustainability. Their commitment to reducing their environmental impact is truly inspiring.

I'm intrigued by your thoughts on collaboration and partnerships between brands, suppliers, and NGOs. By working together, we can share knowledge, expertise, and resources to create systemic change.

Regarding innovation and R&D in driving sustainability in fashion, I think it's essential. Emerging technologies like recycled materials, biodegradable fabrics, or even lab-grown textiles excite me!
